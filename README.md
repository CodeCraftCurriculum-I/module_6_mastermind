# Assignment
Before you write any code, you should "sketch" the pseudo code and make a flowchart for how you plan to do the following alterations to the game.

- Improve the code (readability, maintainability)
- Make the normal / hard choice in the menu have an effect on the game.
- Make it so that the player has 3 lives. (crashing should decrease the life and restart the level).
- Create a pickup that gives lives.
- Create a pickup that takes lives (decreases life without restarting)
- Give points for pickingup food quickly, if food stays more than 5 seconds it does not give food.
- Add a HUD to the game showing lives and score.
- Add a view between the game and menu where there is a summary of result (play time, score)
- The snake can now double back (reverse direction), this is a bug.
